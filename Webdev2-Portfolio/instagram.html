Instagram has recently added a new feature of being able to have a live video so their followers can join and see what the person is doing,

             This app is useful for learning as the lecturer could make a page that the students follow and could start a live video that students can view. Students are able to make pages for a certain course such as a photography page and can follow other well know photographers to get information and ask them questions.

 The first castion is when posting pictures,the user should keep in mind the location setting and the tags you use.
These could easily show your location to people. Tags can also be used to see your interests and your
location so use them with caution.
    The second is if you’re tagged in their posts or
stories. You can un-tag your account from posts but you can’t from stories so you can ask the person to
remove you from the story. Stories aren’t permanent so after 24 hours they get removed.
