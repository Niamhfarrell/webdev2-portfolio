      <p2>
          Facebook is  used by people as a personal news site, where the things posted are about
people they know and by themselves. The majority of people interact on a daily basis so when you log onto
the app or website you will see status updates and photos from the people you are friends with on
Facebook.    
             To keep up to date with people you know and see what they are up to to you can send them a friend
request, you do this by just typing in the person’s name in the search bar, and clicking the icon on their
profile, saying “Add Friend”. The next option is join your companys workspace automatically using your work email address. The last option is find workspaces youre eligible to join by looking up your email address.

       <h1> Cautions</h1>
       
 
 <p2>Facebook is one of them apps where  nothing you write is private. If you were to comment on a post made by someone,
other people can see what you wrote and reply to that specific response.
Second cautions is  increase in cyberbullying
online. This form of bullying is especially bad as people don’t feel they are in the wrong, or think about the persons feelings for the things they
say or do as they are protected by a screen and it allows them to say things that they would never
say in person.
Fake accounts are also extremely dangerous. As there is no real verification method to go through
when creating a Facebook account, there have been cases where people have made false accounts
for malicious purposes. Such as a peadophile luring kids out in public or an account made to mock
someone</p2>
